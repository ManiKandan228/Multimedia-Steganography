## Comprehensive Multimedia Steganography

## About
This project develops a highly secure multimedia steganography system by integrating **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**, **blockchain** technology for data verification, and **AI-driven** adaptive techniques for hiding information. It ensures confidentiality, transparency, and adaptability in data hiding, making it highly resistant to modern-day steganalysis and tampering.

## Features
- **AES Encryption**: Ensures the confidentiality of hidden data.
- **Blockchain Verification**: Provides tamper-proof and transparent verification of steganographic files.
- **AI-Driven Steganography**: Dynamically adjusts hiding techniques based on media conditions (e.g., compression, noise).
- **Adaptive and Robust**: Reduces the risk of detection while maintaining high security.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle a variety of multimedia formats (images, audio, video).

## Requirements
- **Operating System**: Compatible with Windows 10, Ubuntu (64-bit OS recommended).
- **Development Environment**: Python 3.8 or later.
- **Frameworks**:
  - **TensorFlow/Keras**: For integrating AI models.
  - **Blockchain Libraries**: Web3.py or Ethereum for blockchain verification.
  - **Crypto Libraries**: PyCrypto or PyCryptodome for AES encryption.
- **Image Processing Libraries**: OpenCV for handling multimedia files.
- **Additional Tools**: Git for version control, and VSCode for coding and debugging.
